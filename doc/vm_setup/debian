= Debian

Build an Debian base box using the following:

  * http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
  - name: debian
  - Debian
  - 384 MB memory
  - 8 GB dynamically resizing drive

Add the iso to the cd/dvd device under Settings > Storage. Now start the
server and install (use default settings unless specified):

  - select 'SSH server' and 'Standard system utilities' as software to install

When the server has rebooted and is ready at the login screen, remove the
install iso, take a snapshot and setup port forwarding.

  (Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive)
  VBoxManage snapshot debian take RAW
  VBoxManage controlvm debian poweroff
  # wait to fully power off
  VBoxManage modifyvm debian --natpf1 'debian-ssh,tcp,,2222,,22'
  VBoxManage -q snapshot debian restore RAW
  VBoxManage startvm debian

Transfer your ssh key to the vm. Help to generate ssh keys can be found on
{GitHub}[http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect]:

  scp -P 2222 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub USERNAME@localhost:id_rsa.pub

Login as root and SSH for your user:

  vm: su -l USERNAME
  vm: mkdir .ssh
  vm: mv id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: chmod 0700 .ssh
  vm: chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: exit

Remove the login banner and exit:

  vm: rm /etc/motd
  vm: exit

Now take the standard snapshots:

  VBoxManage snapshot debian take BASE
  VBoxManage snapshot debian take CURRENT
  VBoxManage controlvm debian poweroff

To cleanup the port forwarding (run later, if ever):

  VBoxManage modifyvm debian --natpf1 delete 'debian-ssh'
