∴ rvm rvmrc {trust,untrust,trusted,load,reset} [optional-path]

Tools for dealing with and loading the rvmrc trust for a given directory.
All actions take an optional path to a directory to check.

Examples:

To check the status of ~/My/project, you'd run:

  ∴ rvm rvmrc trusted ~/My/project

Or, more conventionally,

  ∴ cd ~/My/project && rvm rvmrc trusted

To manually set it as trusted:

  ∴ rvm rvmrc trust ~/My/project

Or, to reset the trust and force a prompt:

  ∴ rvm rvmrc reset ~/My/project
  
Finally, to load the rvmrc in a directory, you'd run:

  ∴ rvm rvmrc load ~/My/project

Or,

  ∴ cd ~/My/project && rvm rvmrc load
  
Note that this replaces 'rvm load-rvmrc'. Note that load implicity trusts the
rvmrc, even if it is set to untrusted.
