Alias

  RVM allows you to alias your rubies for your convenience and pleasure.

Usage
  rvm [options] alias source destination

  Source and Destination must be an RVM
  ruby string representing an RVM installed ruby.

  A gemset may be optionally included.

Creating Aliases

  First select an RVM ruby.

    ∴ rvm alias create php ree-1.8.7-p2010.01

Using Aliases

  Now that you have created an alias, you can use the alias in place of the longer rvm selector string.

    ∴ rvm use php
    ∴ ruby -v
    ruby 1.8.7 (2009-12-24 patchlevel 248) [i686-darwin10.3.0], MBARI 0x6770, Ruby Enterprise Edition 2010.01

If you use any aliases that are rather funny, please hop in #rvm and let us know :)

Deleting Aliases

  If you wish to delete an alias

  ∴ rvm alias delete dotnet
    Listing Aliases

You can also list all current aliases

  ∴ rvm alias list
    php => ree-1.8.7-p2010.01
    lisp => maglev-head
    python => rbx-head
