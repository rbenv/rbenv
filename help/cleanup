∴ rvm cleanup {all,archives,repos,sources,logs}

Performs general cleanup for the specific set of rvm directories.

Useful for reclaiming used disk space from rvm compiles
and the like.

Examples:

To reclaim all of the space used by archives, repository clones,
source files (and associated temporary compile file) and logs, you'd
run:

  ∴ rvm cleanup all

If instead you only wanted to clean up source files, you'd run:

  ∴ rvm cleanup sources

Please note that sometimes having archives and sources around are desirable.
Namely, you need the sources to install something such as ruby-debug under
1.9.
