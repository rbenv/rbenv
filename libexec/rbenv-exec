# Summary: Run an executable with the selected Ruby version
#
# Usage: rbenv exec <command> [arg1 arg2...]
#
# Runs an executable by first preparing PATH so that the selected Ruby
# version's `bin' directory is at the front.
#
# For example, if the currently selected Ruby version is 1.9.3-p327:
#   rbenv exec bundle install
#
# is equivalent to:
#   PATH="$RBENV_ROOT/versions/1.9.3-p327/bin:$PATH" bundle install

set -e
[ -n "$RBENV_DEBUG" ] && set -x

# Provide rbenv completions
if [ "$1" = "--complete" ]; then
  exec rbenv shims --short
