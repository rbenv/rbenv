.SH "NAME"
rbenv \- manage your application\*(Aqs Ruby environment
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrbenv\fP \fI<command>\fP [\fI<args>\fP...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
rbenv respects the \fI.ruby\-version\fP file in a project directory by making sure that any \fBruby\fP, \fBgem\fP, \fBbundle\fP, or other Ruby command invocation automatically invokes the Ruby version configured for that project.
.sp
It does so by generating shims for all Ruby executables. As long as rbenv shims directory is prepended to PATH, rbenv automatically ensures transparent switching between Ruby versions.
.sp
rbenv looks for available Ruby versions in the \fI{RBENV_ROOT}/versions/\fP directory.
