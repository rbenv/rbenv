# Simple Ruby Version Management: rbenv

<img src="http://i.sstephenson.us/rbenv.png" width="894" height="464">

rbenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Ruby. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

### rbenv _does…_

* Let you **change the global Ruby version** on a per-user basis.
* Provide support for **per-project Ruby versions**.
* Allow you to **override the Ruby version** with an environment
  variable.

### In contrast with rvm, rbenv _does not…_

* **Need to be loaded into your shell.** Instead, rbenv's shim
    approach works by adding a directory to your `$PATH`.
* **Override shell commands like `cd`.** That's dangerous and
    error-prone.
* **Have a configuration file.** There's nothing to configure except
    which version of Ruby you want to use.
* **Install Ruby.** You can build and install Ruby yourself, or use
    [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) to
    automate the process.
* **Manage gemsets.** [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) is a better
    way to manage application dependencies. If you have projects that
    are not yet using Bundler you can install the
    [rbenv-gemset](https://github.com/jamis/rbenv-gemset) plugin.
* **Require changes to Ruby libraries for compatibility.** The
    simplicity of rbenv means as long as it's in your `$PATH`,
    [nothing](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/integration/bundler/)
    [else](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/integration/capistrano/)
    needs to know about it.
* **Prompt you with warnings when you switch to a project.** Instead
    of executing arbitrary code, rbenv reads just the version name
    from each project. There's nothing to "trust."

## <a name="section_1"></a> 1 How It Works

rbenv operates on the per-user directory `~/.rbenv`. Version names in
rbenv correspond to subdirectories of `~/.rbenv/versions`. For
example, you might have `~/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p354` and
`~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-preview1`.

Each version is a working tree with its own binaries, like
`~/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p354/bin/ruby` and
`~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-preview1/irb`. rbenv makes _shim binaries_
for every such binary across all installed versions of Ruby.

These shims are simple wrapper scripts that live in `~/.rbenv/shims`
and detect which Ruby version you want to use. They insert the
directory for the selected version at the beginning of your `$PATH`
and then execute the corresponding binary.

Because of the simplicity of the shim approach, all you need to use
rbenv is `~/.rbenv/shims` in your `$PATH`.

## <a name="section_2"></a> 2 Installation

rbenv is a young project, so for now you must install it from source.

**Compatibility note**: rbenv is _incompatible_ with rvm. Things will
  appear to work until you try to install a gem. The problem is that
  rvm actually overrides the `gem` command with a shell function!
  Please remove any references to rvm before using rbenv.

1. Check out rbenv into `~/.rbenv`.

        $ cd
        $ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv

2. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `rbenv`
command-line utility.

        $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> .bash_profile

3. Add rbenv's shims directory to your `$PATH` and set up Bash
autocompletion. (If you prefer not to load rbenv in your shell, you
can manually add `$HOME/.rbenv/shims` to your path in step 2.)

        $ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> .bash_profile

4. Restart your shell. You can now begin using rbenv.

        $ exec

5. Install Ruby versions into `~/.rbenv/versions`. For example, to
install Ruby 1.9.2-p290, download and unpack the source, then run:

        $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290
        $ make
        $ make install

    The [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
    project simplifies this process to a single command:

        $ rbenv install 1.9.2-p290

6. Rebuild the shim binaries. You should do this any time you install
a new Ruby binary (for example, when installing a new Ruby version, or
when installing a gem that provides a binary).

        $ rbenv rehash

## <a name="section_3"></a> 3 Usage

Like `git`, the `rbenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The most common subcommands are:

### <a name="section_3.1"></a> 3.1 global

Sets the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells by writing
the version name to the `~/.rbenv/global` file. This version can be
overridden by a per-project `.rbenv-version` file, or by setting the
`RBENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ rbenv global 1.9.2-p290

The special version name `system` tells rbenv to use the system Ruby
(detected by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `rbenv global` reports the
currently configured global version.

### <a name="section_3.2"></a> 3.2 local

Sets a local per-project Ruby version by writing the version name to
an `.rbenv-version` file in the current directory. This version
overrides the global, and can be overridden itself by setting the
`RBENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ rbenv local rbx-1.2.4

When run without a version number, `rbenv local` reports the currently
configured local version.

### <a name="section_3.3"></a> 3.3 versions

Lists all Ruby versions known to rbenv, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version.

    $ rbenv versions
      1.8.7-p352
      1.9.2-p290
    * 1.9.3-preview1 (set by /Users/sam/.rbenv/global)
      jruby-1.6.3
      rbx-1.2.4
      ree-1.8.7-2011.03

### <a name="section_3.4"></a> 3.4 version

Displays the currently active Ruby version, along with information on
how it was set.

    $ rbenv version
    1.8.7-p352 (set by /Volumes/37signals/basecamp/.rbenv-version)

### <a name="section_3.5"></a> 3.5 rehash

Installs shims for all Ruby binaries known to rbenv (i.e.,
`~/.rbenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new
version of Ruby, or install a gem that provides binaries.

    $ rbenv rehash

## <a name="section_4"></a> 4 Contributing

The rbenv source code is [hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). It's clean, modular,
and easy to understand, even if you're not a shell hacker.
